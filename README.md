Futoshiki Puzzle (in Java) based on Answer Set Programming

Answer Set Programming is a completely new paradigm of 
programming which solves combinatorial problems in a substantially reduced running time and this is being used widely in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

The Project solves the problem of placing the numbers 1 to 5 such that each row, and column contains each of the digits 1 to 5. Some digits may be given at the start. 

In addition, inequality constraints are also initially specified between some of the squares, such that one must be higher or lower than its neighbour. 

These constraints are honoured as the grid is filled out.Answer Set programming Solver used is "Clingo"
